# Postgis Enabled Rails App
Ruby Version: 2.4.3  
Rails Version: Latest (using git in gem file)  
PostgreSQL: (latest)
This is the current state of the project that I'm adding stuff to

## What's needed next: 

1. On backend: Add tag-user-artist association, on front end: Add a way for user to insert tags from artists page. 

2. Restrict access to pages based on logged in/out.

3. Start working on consolidating events with calendar.
