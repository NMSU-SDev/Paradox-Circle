# Postgis Enabled Rails App
Ruby Version: 2.4.3  
Rails Version: Latest (using git in gem file)  
PostgreSQL: (latest)

## What's needed next: 

1. Redirect to home/show after logging in traditionally (Same place as when you log in with Google/fb), and add a way to go to user profile (users/:id) when you're in home and are logged in.  
2. Add a way for user to insert tags from artists page (in the artist view). 


## As a sidenote

You may need to run sudo apt install wheneverize now as the scheduling functionality depends on it being installed if you do not get an error when trying to test the server don't worry about it.
