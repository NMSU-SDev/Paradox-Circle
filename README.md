# Postgis Enabled Rails App
Ruby Version: 2.4.3  
Rails Version: Latest (using git in gem file)  
PostgreSQL: (latest)
This is the current state of the project that I'm adding stuff to

## What's needed next: 

1. On backend: Add tag-user-artist association, on front end: Add a way for user to insert tags from artists page. 

2. Restrict access to pages based on logged in/out.

3. Start working on consolidating events with calendar. 

## As a sidenote

You may need to run sudo apt install wheneverize now as the scheduling functionality depends on it being installed if you do not get an error when trying to test the server don't worry about it.
